TensorRT Support (Optional)
============================

For maximum GPU performance (~2x speedup over CUDA), you can optionally
install NVIDIA TensorRT.

Installation Steps:
1. Download TensorRT for CUDA 12.9 from:
   https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT#downloading-tensorrt-build

2. Extract the archive and copy these DLLs to the Birda installation folder:
   - nvinfer_10.dll
   - nvinfer_plugin_10.dll
   - nvonnxparser_10.dll

3. Run birda with the --tensorrt flag:
   birda --tensorrt recording.wav

Requirements:
- NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 5.0+ (GTX 10-series and newer)
- TensorRT 10.x for CUDA 12.9

Note: CUDA acceleration (--gpu) works without TensorRT and provides
good performance for most use cases. TensorRT is recommended for
processing large volumes of audio files.
